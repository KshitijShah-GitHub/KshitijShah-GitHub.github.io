# Personal website
Made from scratch with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and JQuery. Meant to display some skills and past projects and make available
some documents and links.

## Known Issues
- Does not look good when zoomed in (Icons clip, horizontal scrolling doesn't show things hidden in the left margin)
- Mobile looks bad, need to update CSS for media screen < some 720px for viewing on smaller displays
- "My Website" Project links to google.com instead of this repository
